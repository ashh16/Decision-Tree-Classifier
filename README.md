# Decision-Tree-Classifier

A decision tree classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by partitioning the input data into subsets based on certain features and their values, ultimately assigning a class label to each subset.

Letâ€™s see few basic steps to perform decision tree classifier using popular python library for machine learning: Scikit-learn.

1)	Import the necessary libraries: Start by importing the required libraries such as numpy, pandas, train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection, DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree and accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix from sklearn.metrics and other needed libraries. 

2)	Load or generate data : Import your dataset you will be working on.

3)	Spliting: Split the data into training and testing data using train_test_split library. Ideal splitting is 70-30 (testing=0.3).

4)	Fit the data & train the model using training data.

5)	Make Predictions

6)	Evaluate the model

7)	Visualize the Decision Tree
